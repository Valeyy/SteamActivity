# SteamActivity

This program minimizes itself to the system tray when you start it. You can add it as a non-steam game to steam and rename it, so you have a [custom steam activity](https://prnt.sc/10ml1kz).

Normally you would have to do this with for example Notepad, which is annoying, because it always stays in your taskbar.

## Installation

1. [Add the SteamActivityChanger.exe as a non-steam game to steam](https://prnt.sc/10mla1c)
    (C:\Users\ ** \AppData\Local\Programs\SteamActivityChanger should be default)
2. [Rename the game in your steam library](https://prnt.sc/10mlevn)
3. [Create a desktop shortcut](https://prnt.sc/10mlfwt)
4. [Move the shortcut to your startup folder](https://prnt.sc/10mlh17)

The program will now automatically start through steam when you start your computer.
